\section{Research Projects}
\textbf{Fast Trajectory Replanning}
\hfill{Summer 2020}\\
Rutgers University
\begin{itemize}
  \itemsep0em
  \item Implemented path planning with Python. Using several modified A* algorithms to find the shortest path for an agent to move toward a goal in an unknown environment with randomly generalized obstacles.
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Face and Digit Classification}
\hfill{Summer 2020}\\
Rutgers University
\begin{itemize}
  \itemsep0em
  \item Designed two classifiers, a Naive Bayes classifier, and a Perceptron classifier. Applied both classifiers to do each of the two tasks: digit recognition and face detection. Obtained over 60\% accuracy for digit recognition and 70\% for facial detection.
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Linear Image Classifier}
\hfill{Spring 2020}\\
Rutgers University
\begin{itemize}
  \itemsep0em
  \item Built a linear image classifier from scratch in PyTorch using CIFAR10 dataset. Implemented both the forward pass and backward pass of the linear classifier without using PyTorch's autograd capabilities.
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Neural Machine Translation}
\hfill{Spring 2020}\\
Rutgers University
\begin{itemize}
  \itemsep0em
  \item Implemented neural machine translation (NMT) models using recurrent neural networks (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM) with attention, and transformers.
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Reinforcement Learning}
\hfill{Spring 2020}\\
Rutgers University
\begin{itemize}
  \itemsep0em
  \item Implemented Deep Q-learning (DQN) to train an agent to play atari pong game from OpenAI Gym environment.
\end{itemize}
